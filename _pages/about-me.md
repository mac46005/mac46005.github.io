# Marco Preciado

I'm Marco Preciado — a loving husband, soldier, and aspiring computer scientist. Currently, I'm pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Missouri — St. Louis.

As a passionate programmer, I specialize in Java but also enjoy supporting my wife by developing custom scripts for her Excel projects.

## My Journey Into Programming

One of my favorite childhood games was Megaman Battle Network for the Gameboy Advance. In the game, a young man named Lan and his AI companion, Megaman, travel through the Internet to fight viruses and help people in need. This game sparked my curiosity and made me wonder: How do computers really work? Are viruses in a computer like the monsters in Megaman Battle Network?

While I quickly discovered that the Internet isn't quite like the one in the game, Megaman Battle Network ignited my imagination and led me to explore the world of programming. It was the first time I realized how complex and fascinating the digital world could be.

My programming journey began with learning C#, and from there, I dove deeper into the world of coding. I was hooked by the idea of solving problems and building systems to make things work—just like in the game.

## Skills & Technologies

I specialize in Java but have a broad understanding of various programming languages and frameworks. Some of the technologies I've worked with include:

- **Programming Languages**: Java, C#, Kotlin, VBA
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS
- **Databases**: SQL, MySQL
- **Tools**: Git, Visual Studio, VSCode, Intellij IDEA, Android Studio
- **Other**: Excel scripting, problem-solving, algorithm design

I'm always looking to expand on my skill set and learn new technologies to tackle complex problems and create efficient solutions.

## My Approach

## Why I Love Programming

Programming allows me to solve complex problems and continously challenge myself. I love the process of breaking down problems into smaller, manageable pieces and finding creative ways to put the puzzled together. The idea that I can create something from scratch—whether it's a small script or a full-scale application—that helps others is incredibly rewarding.

## Let's Work Together!

I'm always open to new opportunities ande challenges. If you're looking for a programmer to help with a project or just want to discuss tech, feel free to reach out to me. Let's create something great together!

## A Little About Me

Outside of programming, I'm a proud husband, soldier, and lifelong learner. When I'm nmot coding, you'll likely find me spending quality time with my wife and family. My cat, dog, and snake are my "children" and always keep life interesting. I enjoy drawing from time to time and love playing video games with my wife. We're passionate about traveling and exploring new places, and we never miss a chance to dance!
